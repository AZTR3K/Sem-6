Read Manual then attempt this exercise.

Submit only one ipynb file, named as your complete roll number. It must have cells of all 3 tasks, and its outputs. Labelled with task number. 


Complete all tasks given below

1) Reverse String (5 Marks)
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of
characters. You can use Python list to create the array of characters. Do not allocate
extra space for another array, you must do this reversal by modifying the input array
in-place with O(1) extra memory.
Example 1:
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]


2) Valid Palindrome (10 Marks)
Given a strings , determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric
characters and ignoring cases. Refer to this link to learn about Python string functions
which might come handy in this task.
Example 1:
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
Example 2:
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.

3) Sqrt(x) without any built-in methods (10 Marks)
Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.
Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the
integer part of the result is returned.
Example 1:
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Example 2:
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated,
2 is returned.
